# Introduction and Vision

Revani is a high-performance NoSQL engine and an integrated technology ecosystem designed to eliminate the cumbersome structures of traditional database management systems, resolve centralized locking bottlenecks, and replace weak security models that leave protection solely to the application layer.

## Our Vision
The core vision of Revani is to transcend being a passive unit that merely stores data, becoming instead a **"fortified technological core"** that carries, processes, and protects it. We believe that in the modern world, speed should not sacrifice security, and security should not sacrifice speed.

## What is Revani?
Revani is a "Technology Box" that solves fundamental backend challenges through a single API and protocol:

**Security Core:** While most systems treat encryption as an optional add-on, it is the foundation of Revani's architecture. All traffic is armored with AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at all times.

**Maximum Concurrency:** Thanks to its Actor Model architecture, it utilizes each CPU core as an independent processing unit, making locking crises a thing of the past.

**Integrated Infrastructure:** Beyond database functions, it consolidates file storage, real-time PubSub, and Livekit communication services within a single tree structure.

### Core Objectives
**Ultra-Low Latency:** Achieving sub-millisecond response times in read operations.

**Zero-Trust:** Ensuring data remains encrypted end-to-end, from the moment a packet reaches the server until it is stored on disk.

**Developer Experience:** Making complex backend infrastructures as easy to use as ready-to-serve products coming out of an "oven."
